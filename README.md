# UK-Accident-Prone-Zone-Detector
This project analyzes traffic accident data in the UK from 2005 to 2014, using K-means and MiniBatchKMeans clustering algorithms to identify high accident-density areas. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of these algorithms to determine if a quicker, low-cost algorithm can deliver results as effectively as a computationally heavier one.
